# LeetStats ✨ - Because Regular Stats are too Mainstream 

Welcome to **LeetStats**! The absolutely, positively, ridiculously over-the-top stats app you never asked for but now can't live without. ✨

## What is LeetStats? 🌐

Picture this: You're solving problems on LeetCode, feeling like a coding ninja 🏋️‍♂️, and suddenly you wonder, _"How many Easy problems have I crushed? How many Medium ones have I raged over? And why does Hard feel like a personal attack?"_

**LeetStats** swoops in like a superhero ✨⚡✨ to answer all those burning questions! Simply type in your LeetCode username, and BOOM ✨— your entire life (okay, just your LeetCode stats) is laid bare in all its glory.

## Features that will blow your socks off 🧦

- **Dynamic Loading** – Fancy* loading spinner because staring at a blank screen is so last decade. 🔁
- **Top Languages** – Find out which language you speak the best… no, not French or Spanish… Python or JavaScript! 🚀
- **Contest Stats** – Because we all love knowing how much better (or worse) we are compared to the rest of the world. 🥇
- **Recent Submissions** – Remind yourself of the problem you failed 5 minutes ago. 😂
- **Cool Badges** – Show off those shiny badges! We’re all magpies at heart. ✨
- **Dark Mode** – Because who needs light when you can live in perpetual darkness like a true developer? 🎮☕
